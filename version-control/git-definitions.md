# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control protects software and allows us to see all revisions to more than one file and then merge those revisions together. It is useful because it allows more than one person to work on a single project seperately and then put all parts of the project together at a later date, while leaving to original code intact. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the master code that can be edited seperately from the master. A branch is used to add updates, correct or revision code for a project while leaving the master code intact.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a saving point. A commit message should be short and clear about what was done in the edit.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when competing changes are made to the same line of code or when a file has been deleted and someone trys to then edit in the file.
